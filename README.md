# Capstone Project - Step 4: Research & Reproduction (Mind Reading Devices)

This repository contains the deliverables for Step 4 of the Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp Capstone project, focusing on surveying existing research and reproducing available solutions for mind-reading devices (specifically EEG-to-Text translation).

## Contents

*   **`/docs`**: Contains detailed documentation summarizing the research findings, identified code repositories, the analysis of different approaches, the log of the reproduction attempt (including challenges faced), and the final conclusions regarding potential improvements for the main Capstone project.
*   **`/code`**: Contains the code repositories cloned from GitHub that were surveyed. The `EEG-To-Text` repository was the primary focus for the reproduction attempt.
    *   *Note:* Due to dataset download issues, no code was executed or modified beyond the initial environment setup attempts documented in `docs/analysis_conclusion.md`.
*   **`/presentation`**: Contains a markdown outline for a presentation summarizing the findings of this step.

## Summary of Work Done (Step 4 Rubric)

1.  **Research Summary:** Documented in `docs/research_summary.md`.
2.  **Available Code:** Documented in `docs/code_repositories.md`.
3.  **Reproduction Attempt:** Attempted using `code/EEG-To-Text`. Process and challenges (dataset download failure) documented in `docs/analysis_conclusion.md`. No successfully executed notebooks due to blockage.
4.  **Conclusion/Analysis:** Detailed analysis of findings, comparison of approaches (Invasive vs. fMRI vs. EEG), learnings, and potential Capstone improvements documented in `docs/analysis_conclusion.md`.
5.  **Demonstration:** The analysis document (`docs/analysis_conclusion.md`) details the findings and the state of the reproduction attempt.
6.  **GitHub Upload:** This structured folder is prepared for upload to a GitHub repository.
