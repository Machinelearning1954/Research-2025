- **Summary:** This article discusses how brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), including implants and other technologies that decode neural activity, are being used to restore abilities like movement and speech for people with paralysis. It also highlights how these technologies help researchers understand brain function, potentially overturning assumptions about brain anatomy and learning.

## 2. Mind-reading in AI and neurotechnology: evaluating claims, hype, and ethical implications for neurorights

- **Abstract:** This paper examines claims that the convergence of AI and neurotechnology applications, known as brain-reading, enables the reading of human minds. The purpose of this examination is to investigate whether the use of the terms “brain-reading” and “mind-reading” to convey current neurotechnological findings carries evidence of hype. We conducted an interpretive content analysis of 1017 academic articles to gain insights into the current state of the art and examine assertions made by academics. Our analysis revealed that up to 91% of the examined articles suggest the possibility of mind-reading through brain-reading. Ethical issues discussed frequently include mental privacy, mental freedom, and personhood. Our study highlights the imprecise and inconsistent usage of the term mind-reading in scientific discourse, which leads to exaggerated claims about AI and BCIs having already achieved capacities beyond their current capabilities—or even reaching capacities that may never be feasible. While our study provides evidence of AI and BCI hype concerning alleged mind-reading capabilities, it also uncovers a hype in AI ethics, specifically pertaining to neurorights. This involves hypothetical scenarios where the fictional prospect of AI-enabled mind-reading calls for the establishment of new protective human rights.

## 3. Brain Recording, Mind-Reading, and Neurotechnology: Ethical Issues from Consumer Devices to Brain-Based Speech Decoding

- **Abstract:** Brain reading technologies are rapidly being developed in a number of neuroscience fields. These technologies can record, process, and decode neural signals. This has been described as ‘mind reading technology’ in some instances, especially in popular media. Should the public at large, be concerned about this kind of technology? Can it really read minds? Concerns about mind-reading might include the thought that, in having one’s mind open to view, the possibility for free deliberation, and for self-conception, are eroded where one isn’t at liberty to privately mull things over. Themes including privacy, cognitive liberty, and self-conception and expression appear to be areas of vital ethical concern. Overall, this article explores whether brain reading technologies are really mind reading technologies. If they are, ethical ways to deal with them must be developed. If they are not, researchers and technology developers need to find ways to describe them more accurately, in order to dispel unwarranted concerns and address appropriately those that are warranted.

## 4. How to deal with mind-reading technologies

- **Authors:** Roberto Andorno, Andrea Lavazza
- **Date:** 14 November 2023
- **Summary:** This opinion article discusses the emergence of mind-reading technologies, particularly using fMRI and AI, referencing Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*. It highlights the dual-use nature of these technologies – potential benefits for patients versus risks to mental privacy, freedom of thought, and personal identity. The authors discuss techniques like decoding electrical signals for phonation and decoding brain activity correlated with thoughts (e.g., reconstructing verbalizations, images). They raise concerns about potential misuse, coercion, and the need for ethical safeguards like 



## 5. Portable, non-invasive, mind-reading AI turns thoughts into text

- **Source:** University of Technology Sydney (UTS) News
- **URL:** https://www.uts.edu.au/news/tech-design/portable-non-invasive-mind-reading-ai-turns-thoughts-text
- **Date:** 12 December 2023
- **Summary:** This news article describes a portable, non-invasive system developed by researchers at UTS (GrapheneX-UTS Human-centric Artificial Intelligence Centre) that decodes silent thoughts into text using EEG and AI. The system uses a cap to record EEG signals while participants read text silently. An AI model called DeWave, developed by the researchers, translates these EEG signals into words and sentences. The research was presented at the NeurIPS conference. It aims to aid communication for non-verbal individuals and enable human-machine interaction. Unlike previous methods requiring surgery (implants) or fMRI, this uses non-invasive EEG. The model was trained on 29 participants and achieved a translation accuracy score (BLEU-1) of around 40%.

- **Date:** September 2023 (arXiv), Presented Dec 2023 (NeurIPS)
- **Abstract:** This paper introduces DeWave, a novel framework that integrates discrete encoding sequences into open-vocabulary EEG-to-text translation tasks. It aims to translate raw EEG waves directly into language, using discrete encoding techniques (VQ-VAE) and leveraging large language models. The approach was tested on the ZuCo dataset.
